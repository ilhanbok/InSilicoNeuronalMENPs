# LFPy Single Morphology Models

## Background
This model is used to simulate single Allen Brain Atlas morphologies using given parameters and constants

## Usage
Run `.\loopmorpho<x>.bat`. Where `<x>` is `Pyr`,`PC`, or `L23`.
After all files have been generated, run `CategoricalPlotGenerator.m` in MATLAB R2021a or later. Change variable `dir` in `parseRepr2.m` to change the direction of the DC magnetic field.
